# Tailwind CSS Classes Not Applying Correctly

This repository demonstrates an uncommon bug in Tailwind CSS where classes fail to apply due to unexpected CSS specificity or conflicting styles.  The issue is likely caused by a poorly structured CSS cascade where more specific styles override expected Tailwind classes.  The solution involves understanding CSS specificity and using appropriate techniques to ensure the desired styles are applied correctly.

## Bug

The `bug.js` file contains a simple React component that utilizes Tailwind CSS classes. However, these classes may not apply correctly due to the aforementioned CSS specificity issue. This is especially prevalent when using custom CSS or third-party libraries that might unknowingly overwrite Tailwind's styles.

## Solution

The `bugSolution.js` file shows how to resolve the issue. This might involve various strategies:

* **Using !important (as a last resort):** While generally discouraged, adding `!important` can force styles to override others. However, this should be used sparingly to avoid unwanted side effects.
* **Increasing specificity:** Using more specific selectors (e.g., adding an ID to the element) helps ensure your Tailwind classes take precedence.
* **Using the `@layer` directive:** This allows you to manage the order of your CSS rules, giving you finer control over the cascade.  This is the preferred approach over `!important`.
* **Inspecting the CSS:** Using your browser's developer tools (e.g., Chrome DevTools) will help determine why your styles aren't being applied.  Look for conflicting styles or unexpected specificity rules.

This repository aims to illustrate a less common Tailwind CSS issue and its resolution, emphasizing best practices for resolving CSS specificity conflicts.
